# Zircon petrochronology
This is an experiment and a work in progress to develop a zircon petrochronology archive. The purpose of this repository is to 1) archive compiled data, and 2) provide some examples of how these data can be processed and visualised using the [R language and software](https://www.r-project.org/). I am hoping to slowly add to this project as time goes on. For starters, I have added an initial version of a zircon geochronology and trace element geochemistry compilation [here](https://github.com/cverdel/zircon_petrochronology/blob/main/zircon_data_table_v0.csv). 

This figure shows where the zircons are from.

Below is a density plot of the ages of zircons in the compilation.
